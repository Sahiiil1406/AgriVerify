# AgriVerify
AgriVerify, where you'll blend blockchain technology with organic farming to bring trust and transparency to every crop grown! In this task, you’ll be creating a decentralized platform that empowers farmers to easily certify their organic produce and generate QR codes that consumers can scan for instant verification.

Imagine walking through a market, scanning a QR code on an apple, and instantly seeing its certification, the farm it came from, and the people behind it—all with the power of blockchain!
